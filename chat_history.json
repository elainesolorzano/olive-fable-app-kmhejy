You want an all-in-one app for Olive & Fable Studio, a luxury pet portrait business. The app will cater to different user roles (Visitor, Registered User, Paid Member, Booked Client) and will have five main tabs: Home, Learn, Book, Workshops, and My Studio. The design should be luxury, minimal, and use neutral tones, with Gemma (the CEO dog) as the voice throughout the app.\n\nHere's a plan to get started:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n*   **Home Screen:** A dynamic home screen that displays content based on the user's role. This includes a welcome message from Gemma, a featured posing tip, call-to-action buttons, and membership/booking prompts.\n*   **Learn Section:** An educational content library with categories like \"Posing Your Pet\" and \"Preparing for Your Session.\" Access to content will be role-based, with limited free content and full access for members.\n*   **My Studio:** An account hub where users can manage their profile, membership status, saved content, and purchases. Booked clients will also have access to a Client Portal with session details and resources.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#F8F8F8` (Very light gray)\n    *   Text: `#333333` (Dark gray)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#666666` (Medium gray)\n    *   Primary: `#A78B71` (Taupe)\n    *   Secondary: `#D4A373` (Light Beige)\n    *   Accent: `#E2DCC8` (Off-White)\n    *   Card: `#FFFFFF` (White)\n    *   Highlight: `#F5EFE6` (Almost White)\n*   **Typography:** Use modern, clean fonts like Montserrat or Lato for a luxurious and minimal feel.\n\nNow, let's create a plan for the coding agent to implement these changes.\n\n**Plan for the Coding Agent:**\n\n1.  **Set up the basic tab structure:** Modify the `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` file to create the five tabs: Home, Learn, Book, Workshops, and My Studio. Use the tab names provided by the user.\n2.  **Implement the Home screen:** Modify the `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` file to include the dynamic content blocks for the Home screen. For now, use placeholder content for each block (welcome message, posing tip, call to action, etc.). The content should be role-based, but for now, create a single version that is visible for all roles.\n3.  **Implement the Learn section:** Create the `app/(tabs)/learn/index.tsx` file and add the educational content library structure. Include the categories (Posing Your Pet, Preparing for Your Session, etc.) and placeholder content for each category. Implement the access rules later.\n4.  **Implement the My Studio section:** Create the `app/(tabs)/my-studio/index.tsx` file and add the account hub structure. Include sections for Profile, Membership status, Saved content, Purchases, and Client Portal (conditional). The Client Portal should be hidden for now.\n5.  **Implement the Book section:** Create the `app/(tabs)/book/index.tsx` file and add the content for session discovery and booking. Include the session type cards and the \"Book with Olive & Fable\" button with an external link to HoneyBook.\n6.  **Implement the Workshops section:** Create the `app/(tabs)/workshops/index.tsx` file and add the \"Coming Soon\" placeholder content with the \"Notify Me When Workshops Launch\" and \"Join Membership for Early Access\" buttons.\n7.  **Apply the design elements:** Use the specified colors and typography to style the app.\n8.  **Remove modal demos:** Remove the `modalDemos` array from `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`.\n\nLet's create an elegant and functional mobile app!\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2026-01-02T01:31:24.208864"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll start by searching the knowledge base for relevant information about React Native navigation, tab bars, and any specific patterns that might be useful for this luxury pet portrait app."}, {"type": "search_knowledge_base"}, {"type": "search_knowledge_base"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Now let me read the current file structure to understand what exists:"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "styles/commonStyles.ts", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "components/IconSymbol.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Now let me search for icon names that would be suitable for this app:"}, {"type": "search_knowledge_base"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Perfect!
